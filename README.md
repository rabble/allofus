# All of US Directory

A directory connecting individuals with organizations working across various social justice movements. Our platform helps you discover and engage with groups making real change in communities across the country.

## Mission

All of US provides action pathways for each of us to come together to make our communities, our jobs, and our daily lives better for all of us. We are here as a service during difficult times, connecting people who care about their communities with organizations working on a wide range of issues throughout the country.

The groups in this directory offer ways for people to:
- Support each other after extreme weather disasters
- Stop evictions and deportations
- Work for higher wages and workplace respect
- Advance racial and gender justice
- Bring healthcare and reproductive rights to all
- Protect our environment and achieve climate justice
- Get involved in elections locally and nationally
- And much more
