  description: "The Palestinian solidarity movement advocates for the rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people, emphasizing the end of occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. It seeks to address and rectify injustices faced by Palestinians through various forms of activism, including political advocacy, public education, and economic measures like boycotts and divestments.",
  context: "Historically, the movement has drawn parallels with other anti-colonial and civil rights struggles, emphasizing themes of decolonization and self-determination. In recent years, it has gained momentum through grassroots activism, academic discourse, and international campaigns, such as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement."
