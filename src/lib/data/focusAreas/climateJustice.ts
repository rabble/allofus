  title: "Climate Justice",
  description: "The climate justice movement addresses the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities, emphasizing that those least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions often suffer the most severe consequences. It seeks equitable solutions that rectify systemic injustices, advocating for policies that prioritize vulnerable populations and ensure fair distribution of both the burdens and benefits of climate action.",
  context: "Emerging from the environmental justice movements of the 1960s, climate justice has evolved to highlight the intersection of environmental degradation and social inequality. Historically, industrial activities have disproportionately affected low-income communities and people of color, leading to health disparities and economic disadvantages. In recent years, the movement has gained momentum, with increased awareness of climate change's unequal impacts and a growing call for systemic change."
